# License-Plate-Recognition
This project uses YOLOv8 for detecting license plates and EasyOCR for optical character recognition (OCR) to recognize the text on the detected plates. The system takes an image as input, detects the license plate, and extracts the text. The project can be integrated into a Streamlit web app for easy use.
